# Calculator

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a functional calculator application. Its primary purpose is to perform basic arithmetic operations, providing users with a straightforward tool for calculations.

## Features

(Once you start building, you can list the specific features here. For now, here are some common ones you might include:)

* *Basic Arithmetic:* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* *Clear Functionality:* Ability to clear the current input or calculation.
* *User-Friendly Interface:* An intuitive layout for easy operation.
* (You might also add: Percentage calculations, decimal support, keyboard input, history, etc.)

## Technologies Used

(What programming language and/or frameworks are you using? Here are some common examples, pick what applies or replace them:)

* *Frontend:*
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
* *Backend:* (If it's a web-based calculator with a backend, otherwise you can remove this)
    * Python (e.g., Flask, Django)
    * Node.js (e.g., Express)
* *Desktop Application:* (If it's a desktop app)
    * Python (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt)
    * Java (e.g., Swing, JavaFX)
    * C# (e.g., WPF, WinForms)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

(What do users need to have installed on their machine to run your calculator?)

* A web browser (for HTML/CSS/JS calculators)
* Node.js (if using Node.js)
* Python (if using Python)
* Git (to clone the repository)

### Installation

1.  *Clone the repository:*
    bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/calculator.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/calculator.git)
    
    *(Replace YourUsername/calculator.git with the actual link to your repository once you create it.)*

2.  *Navigate to the project directory:*
    bash
    cd calculator
    

3.  *Install dependencies (if any):*
    (Examples - adjust based on your technology choice)
    * For Node.js projects:
        bash
        npm install
        
    * For Python projects (if using a requirements.txt):
        bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        

### Running the Application

(How do users start your calculator?)

* *For Web-based (HTML/CSS/JS):*
    Open the index.html file in your web browser.
    bash
    # Example (may vary by OS and setup)
    open index.html
    
    Or simply double-click the index.html file.

* *For Node.js applications:*
    bash
    node app.js
    
    *(Replace app.js with your main application file name)*

* *For Python applications:*
    bash
    python main.py
    
    *(Replace main.py with your main application file name)*
